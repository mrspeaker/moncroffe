Minecraft style boxel demo... by Mr Speaker

# bugz
- can add block in position currently standing
- can't have "negative" chunks
- hit head slide down (and can get stuck in block)
- camera looks through block when looking straight down
- ray misses default to 0,0

# perf
- re-mesh (when add/remove block) is super slow
- no meshing - all blocks added
- load meshes in webworker

# needs
- ambient occlusion
